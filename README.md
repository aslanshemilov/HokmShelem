This is a multi-player card game platform designed to provide a comprehensive and enjoyable gaming experience, combining the thrill of competition with the fun of social interaction. Players can sign up and create profiles, view other players' profiles (including rating, score, about, and profile picture), connect to the chat lobby to chat with other players, and create games. Other players can join these games and play card games in teams of two, with the ability to chat and enjoy their time together during gameplay.

In this application, we offer two types of games:

1. Hokm: 
This is a four-player trick-taking game played in teams of two. Its rules are similar to the whist card game and it is extremely popular in Iran.

2. Shelem: 
This is also a trick-taking game similar to Hokm. The difference is that the scoring logic is based on an unusual bidding system where players predict the score they will achieve.
